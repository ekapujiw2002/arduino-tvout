The goal of this project is to create a simple interupt driven library for generating composite video on a single AVR chip.

Currently the output is NTSC or PAL at a resolution of 128x96 by default. The library currently works on ATmega168,328,1280,2560,644p,1284p,AT90USB1286 and more can be added by editing one file.
